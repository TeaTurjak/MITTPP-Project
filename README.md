### Setting up the project, creating and using test cases
                
----
- Using Visual Studio 2019 new Unit Test (.NET Framework) project was created using C#
- NuGet packeges were added to the project so that test cases could be used
- After that Katalon Recorder was used to create test cases on HCL website using Mozilla Firefox web browser
- To create the test cases user had to record the test case activity using Katalon Recorder
- That is done in a way in which user records all steps that they had taken on a web browser until the test case is complete
- Afterwards user tests the created test case
- If the test case was successfull, user can continue making other test cases
- After the test cases were successfully created and tested using Katalon Recorder, Katalon Recorder is used to export desired test cases in a C# (WebDriver + NUnit) format
- After the test cases are exported, they are added to the created project that was made using Visual Studio 2019 and the project is done
